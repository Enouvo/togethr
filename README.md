A crowdfunding platform for creators and artists build on Flow blockchain.

This is team enouvo's submission for [Mercury Hackathon 2021](http://mercuryhackathon2021.com), in track #3 Flow.

## Problem

It is hard for creators and artists to raise funds for a project they are working on. Traditional crowdfunding platforms are centralized and do not offer anonymity, data integrity, and resistance to censorship.

It is also challenging for the creators to find a marketplace to sell their finished project and incentivize supporters.

## Solution

Our solution is to use Flow blockchain to build a decentralized crowdfunding platform that not only allows creators to raise funds but also sells their creations and shares their profits with the funders.

## Start a new crowdfunding project
Setting up a new project is easy, simply provide information like project name, description, and artwork.
Then select a name for your custom token, the price for each token and how many tokens would you like to sell. 
Each token represents a share and a contribution to the project.

Creators can share profits from their project's sale with the funders where each token will be used as a fraction of the project owned by the funder.

## Sell a project 
After a project is funded, creators can use the money raised to work on the project. Once the project is ready, they can use our marketplace to sell the project as an NFT.


## Fractional NFT

We used the concept of fractional NFT to share the ownership of a project. Each funder who contributed to a project by buying the project's token owns a fraction of the project.

For example, a creator working on a music album can start a new funding project on our platform.

The creator decides to sell 100 $MUSIC tokens for 10.00 Flow coins each to raise 1,000.00 Flow coins and share 10% of the profits with the funders.

Once the project is funded and completed, the creator can then use our marketplace to sell the music album as an NFT with the buyer owning all the copyright of the music album.

If the NFT was sold for 100,000.00 Flow coins, 10,000.00 Flow coins are distributed to the funders i.e. 100 Flow coins for each token they own.

## Next steps

- Ability for creators to dynamically create fungible tokens (FT) for their project and use fungible tokens to track the ownership of a project. 
- Ability for the owners to mark a project as funded even if all tokens are not sold.
- Improve user experience by making the website responsive.
- Optimise smart contracts, cadence scripts, and transactions.
- Get the contract audited and launch the project on the main Flow network :)
